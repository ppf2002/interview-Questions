How to Mitigate Identification and Authentication Failures:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password requirements, including length, complexity, and regular changes.
Rate Limiting: Limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
Secure Session Management: Use strong session IDs, expire sessions after inactivity, and invalidate sessions when users log out.
Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
User Education: Train users on secure password practices and the importance of protecting their credentials.

Preventing CSRF in Classic ASP:

The most effective method to prevent CSRF in Classic ASP is by implementing the Synchronizer Token Pattern:

Generate a CSRF Token:
On the server-side (Classic ASP), generate a unique, unpredictable, and session-specific token for each user's session. This token should not be predictable by an attacker.
Embed in Forms:
Include this token as a hidden field within all HTML forms that perform sensitive actions.
Validate on Submission:
When a form is submitted, the Classic ASP application should verify that the submitted token matches the one stored in the user's session. If they don't match, the request should be rejected.

Mitigation Strategies for XSS in Classic ASP:

Input Validation:
.
Validate and sanitize all user input on the server-side, ensuring it conforms to expected data types and formats. Reject or filter out potentially malicious characters or scripts.

Output Encoding:
.
Crucially, encode all user-supplied data before rendering it in the HTML output. This converts potentially harmful characters into their HTML entity equivalents, preventing the browser from interpreting them as executable code. In Classic ASP, you can use functions like Server.HTMLEncode to achieve this.

Identification and authentication failure:

Mitigation Strategies:

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
Enforce Strong Password Policies: Require complex, unique passwords and implement regular password changes.
Validate User Input: Ensure that user inputs (e.g., passwords, usernames) are validated to prevent attacks.
Secure Session Management: Implement secure session token handling, including proper expiration and invalidation.
Rate Limiting: Limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
Secure Credential Storage: Use strong encryption to protect stored credentials, according to Cyolo.
Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
